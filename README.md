# Nero

**Your AI companion who knows you.**

Nero is not a productivity app. Not a to-do list. It's a partner who remembers your conversations, understands your ADHD brain, and helps you actually do the things you need to do.

## What Makes Nero Different

- **One continuous conversation** - Not sessions or chats. One ongoing relationship.
- **Real memory** - Nero remembers what you've told it, what you've committed to, what you struggle with.
- **No features** - No gamification, no dashboards, no complexity. Just talking to someone who knows you.
- **ADHD-native** - Built by someone with ADHD, for people with ADHD.

## The Philosophy

Most ADHD apps treat ADHD like a knowledge problem. They give you lists, reminders, systems.

But ADHD isn't about knowing what to do. It's about doing what you know.

Nero helps you bridge that gap. Not with more information, but with presence.

## Try It

🌐 **Live**: [nero-app.vercel.app](https://nero-app.vercel.app)

## Tech Stack

- React Native / Expo
- Claude AI (optional - works without API key too)
- AsyncStorage for local persistence

## Setup (Optional)

Add your Claude API key in Settings for smarter responses. Without it, Nero still works - just with simpler responses.
