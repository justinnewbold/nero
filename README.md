# Nero

**Your AI companion who knows you.**

Nero is not a productivity app. Not a to-do list. It's a partner who remembers your conversations, understands your ADHD brain, and helps you actually do the things you need to do.

## Try It

## Features

### Voice + Text (Seamless)

### ADHD-Native Design
- Short responses. No walls of text.
- One question at a time (max). Often zero.
- No gamification, no dashboards, no complexity.
- Just a partner who helps you do the thing.

## What Makes This Different

Most ADHD apps treat ADHD like a knowledge problem. More lists. More reminders. More systems.

But ADHD isn't about knowing what to do. It's about doing what you know.

Nero helps you bridge that gap. Not with more information, but with presence.

## Setup (Optional)

Add your Claude API key in Settings for smarter responses. Without it, Nero still works with simpler responses.
